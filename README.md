hack-gui-2010
=============
This is my old hack GUI class, screenshots below. Nothing more to say.

Notes:
- I used a lot of namespaces because when I coded this years ago, I thought they were cool
- I did not make objects properly, for some reason I thought it'd be a good idea to make a new class for each UI object. Dumb.
- I did a lot of other dumb things. I was younger, and inebriated most of the time.
- Good luck.
